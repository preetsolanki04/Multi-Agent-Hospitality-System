#  Multi-Agent Hospitality System

> AI-Powered Travel Planning Platform using Collaborative Agents

---

## 📌 Project Description

The **Multi-Agent Hospitality System** is an intelligent travel planning platform that uses multiple AI agents working collaboratively to generate personalized travel itineraries. The system simulates real-world hospitality workflows where different agents handle specialized responsibilities such as researching destinations, gathering travel data, and composing structured travel plans.

This project demonstrates how **Multi-Agent Systems + LLMs + Modern Web Technologies** can automate complex decision-making and deliver smart travel recommendations.
